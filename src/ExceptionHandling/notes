Exception::- 	Problems that the application can handle or recover from.
                Exceptions are caused by incorrect application logic or data.
                Typically handled using try-catch blocks or declared with throws.
                example: File not found, invalid user input, database connection issues.


Error:-          Problems that the application cannot handle or recover from.
                 Errors are caused by JVM or resource failures (e.g., memory).
                 Includes critical JVM-related errors like VirtualMachineError.
                 example: Running out of heap memory, infinite recursion causing stack overflow.


CheckedException (complile time exceptions):-
                    Exceptions that are checked at compile time.
                    They are declared using the throws keyword in the method signature or try-catch blocks.
                    example: IOException, FileNotFoundException, SQLException.


RuntimeException:-These are runtime exceptions that occur due to programming errors.
                  The compiler does not enforce handling of these exceptions,
                  but they can be handled optionally using try-catch.
                  example: NullPointerException, IndexOutOfBoundsException, ArithmeticException.
